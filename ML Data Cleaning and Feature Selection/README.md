ML Data Cleaning and Feature Selection for Bank Personal Loan Modeling
Project Description:
This project delves into the world of predictive learning by implementing a dataset-based personal loan modeling approach for a bank. The process involves:
•	Exploring and visualizing the data using pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
•	Cleaning data by identifying and handling missing values, outliers, and potential inconsistencies.
•	Employing feature selection techniques to identify the most impactful features for the prediction task.
•	Evaluating classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBClassifier) to assess their effectiveness in predicting loan acceptance.
Data Source:
•	The original dataset used in this project is not provided. You can either specify the source of your data or mention that it's for demonstration purposes only.
Tools and Technologies:
•	Python
•	pandas
•	NumPy
•	Matplotlib
•	scikit-learn
•	XGBoost
Key Steps:
Data Loading and Exploration:
•	Import the dataset using pandas.
•	Understand the data's structure and descriptive statistics.
•	Perform initial visualization to detect any patterns or issues.
Data Cleaning:
•	Identify and handle missing values using suitable techniques (e.g., imputation, deletion).
•	Detect and address outliers based on domain knowledge and statistical methods.
•	Correct any data inconsistencies or errors.
Feature Selection:
•	Analyze feature importance using methods like correlation analysis and permutation importance.
•	Employ feature selection techniques (e.g., chi-square test, information gain) to select the most relevant features for the prediction task.
Model Training and Evaluation:
•	Split the data into training and testing sets.
•	Train and evaluate several classification models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
•	Compare the performance of different models to choose the one that best suits the task.
Results and Findings:
•	Provide a summary of the data cleaning process, including any specific actions taken and their rationale.
•	Discuss the feature selection results, highlighting the key features identified for predicting loan acceptance.
•	Present the performance metrics of the evaluated models, comparing their strengths and weaknesses.
Future Directions:
•	Explore hyperparameter tuning to further improve the performance of the chosen model.
•	Consider applying advanced feature engineering techniques to potentially extract new features with greater predictive power.
•	Investigate the use of other machine learning algorithms to see if they lead to better results for this particular use case.
