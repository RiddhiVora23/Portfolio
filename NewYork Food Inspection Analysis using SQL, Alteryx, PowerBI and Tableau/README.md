**New York Food Inspection Data Analysis**



This project focuses on analyzing data related to food inspections conducted in New York City. The aim is to gain insights that can contribute to food safety measures, compliance improvements, and better decision-making within the regulatory and restaurant industries.


**Data Acquisition**


The project starts by retrieving a CSV file containing food inspection data from a source that is not specified but is likely related to Google+. This dataset is assumed to include extensive information about food inspections in New York City.


**Methodology**


The following steps outline the project's overall approach:


**Data Loading and Cleaning:**

Employ Alteryx to streamline data ingestion and ensure data quality.

Address data anomalies such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies to ensure data integrity and reliability.


**ETL Pipelining:**

Construct a robust ETL pipeline using Alteryx to manage data transformations.

This may involve merging data from various sources, aggregating data, and generating new calculated fields to enrich the dataset for further analysis.


**Data Visualization:**

Leverage data visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI to create informative and interactive visualizations that present key findings and trends from the inspection data.

These visualizations can aid stakeholders in making informed decisions and identifying areas for improvement.
