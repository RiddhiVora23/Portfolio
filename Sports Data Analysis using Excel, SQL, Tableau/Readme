Excel Cleaning

*Data Exploration and Cleaning*

*Customer and Order Dataset*

*Tasks Performed:*

1. *Data Import*: Read the data properly into Excel.
2. *Remove Duplicates*: Removed all duplicate values from the dataset.
3. *Text to Columns*:
    - In the "Order" column, removed the string part and kept only the numeric order ID.
    - In the "Customer ID" column, removed the string part and kept only the numeric customer ID.
4. *CONCAT*: Concatenated the first name and last name of the customer into a single column.
5. *TRIM*: Trimmed extra white spaces from the "State" column.
6. *Date Formats*: Formatted dates in the "m/d/yyyy" format.
7. *PROPER*: Capitalized the first letter of the "Sport" column.
8. *IF Statements*:
    - Applied a rule to calculate shipping cost based on order value:
        - If order value < $49, shipping cost = $7.
        - If order value >= $49, shipping cost = Free.

*Output:* A cleaned and formatted dataset ready for analysis.
