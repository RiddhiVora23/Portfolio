# Spotify Data Pipeline: Extract, Transform, and Analyze with AWS

Spotify data pipeline: Extract, transform, and analyze using AWS, Lambda, Glue, Athena, and S3

## **OBJECTIVE:**

This project constructs a data pipeline on AWS to streamline the extraction, transformation, and analysis of Spotify data.

**Key Highlights:**

**Automated Data Extraction:**

Leverages the Spotify API to retrieve relevant data.

Utilizes AWS Lambda for scheduled or event-triggered data extraction.

Stores retrieved data in a well-organized manner on AWS S3.

**Data Transformation:**

Cleans and formats the extracted data for further analysis.

Handles tasks like normalization, aggregation, and filtering based on needs.

Employs an automated trigger for efficient and reliable data processing.

**Enabling Analytics:**

Transformed data is stored back in AWS S3 with proper organization.

AWS Glue and Athena are used to create analytics tables.

These tables define the data structure and allow efficient querying and analysis.

**Benefits:**

Scalability: The pipeline can handle varying data volumes.

Reliability: Automated processes ensure consistent data flow.

Efficiency: Triggers optimize data processing based on updates.

Seamless Analytics: Enables easy access and in-depth analysis of the data.
