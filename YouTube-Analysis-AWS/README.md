#**YouTube-Analysis-Project-On-AWS**



**Overview:**


The objective of this project is to handle structured and semi-structured YouTube video data in a safe manner, optimize it, and do analysis on it using trending metrics and video categories.


**Dataset:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new

**Goal:**

1.	**Data Ingestion**: Construct a system to take in information from many sources.
2.	**ETL System**: We receive data in raw form and convert it to the appropriate format.
3.	**Data lake**: To store the data that we will be obtaining from various sources, we need a centralized repository.
4.	**Scalability:** We must ensure that our system can grow as our data grows.
5.	**Cloud**: Since our local computer cannot handle processing large volumes of data, we must use the cloud; in this instance, AWS 
6.	**Reporting**: Create a dashboard to obtain the responses to the previous query.

**AWS Services I will Use in this Project:**

1.	**Amazon S3:** Amazon S3 is an object storage service that provides manufacturing scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
2.	**AWS IAM:** This is nothing but identity and access management which enables us to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.
3.	**QuickSight:** Amazon QuickSight is a scalable, serverless, embeddable, machine learning-powered business intelligence (BI) service built for the cloud.
4.	**AWS Glue:** A serverless data integration service that makes it easy to discover, prepare, and combine data for analytics, machine learning, and application development.
5.	**AWS Lambda**: Lambda is a computing service that allows programmers to run code without creating or managing servers.
6.	**AWS Athena**: Athena is an interactive query service for S3 in which there is no need to load data it stays in S3.
